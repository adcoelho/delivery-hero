# Code challenge

The objective of this code challenge is to develop a backend service or api.

I am developing an Api for CRUD operations over Restaurant objects.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. To get the server running you just need to run the docker-compose up command from the top level directory of the project.

```
docker-compose up
```

## Built With

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - For containerizing the application
* [Django 2.0](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - The web framework used
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - For data persistence
